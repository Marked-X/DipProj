Fuzzy logic "calculator" for HVAC system with Mamdani algorythm, my graduate work

Results given are equal to the Mathlab, can probably change this to work with any fuzzy system by changing rules and variables, classes and algorithms should support any amount
of rules and variables, with some tweaking i think all of the rule and variable filling can be done from files/by hand at run time, so that it can become a fuzzy calculator for any
system, but i don't care enough to do that.
